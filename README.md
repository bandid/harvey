Introducing Harvey: A WordPress Bootstrap Starter Theme
===

Harvey is a starter theme that I built that integrates the Twitter Bootstrap Framework with the _s theme from Automattic. I love Bootstrap and WordPress and in the past I’ve played around with a couple of starter themes and frameworks that integrate both. The problem with using other people’s frameworks and themes is having to learn someone else’s code, plus you can never really fully understand the code unless you built it yourself. That is why I decided to built my own starter theme from scratch, which would also serves as a base and framework for my other WordPress/Bootstrap projects.

The thing about Harvey is that since it uses the _s theme from Automattic (the guys responsible for WordPress) it's built using the best WordPress coding standards. Also since it is very minimalist and barebones it can be a great starting point  for anyone who's first stepping into theme development as well as for the experienced user for quick development.

You can download it and test it out yourself on github.

It's free!!
